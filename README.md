# BSW-class
> This class allows the mathematical simulation of water content (BS&Wo) at the outlet of the electrostatic coalescer based on the operating conditions of the coalescer and free variables of the treated water/oil emulsion.

## 📖 Overview
This repository contains the source code for **BSW-class**, developed by **Jurgen Lange Bregado and Argimiro R. Secchi** at the **Laboratory of Software Development for Process Control and Optimization (LADES)**, affiliated with the **Programa de Engenharia Química (PEQ), Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ)**.

The purpose of this project is to provide tools for modeling BS&Wo in electrostatic coalescers using semiempirical mathematical formulations. This repository serves as a resource for **researchers, control engineers, and practitioners**  working in **process control, predictive modeling, and automation**.

## 🚀 Features
- BS&Wo prediction **offline only (this version)**
- Implementation of class in **Python code**
- Class adapted for **practical applications and industrial simulations**
- **Nonlinear optimization** of parameters with and without constraints in the semi-empirical formulations
